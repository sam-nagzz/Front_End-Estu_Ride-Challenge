# Simple Airbnb-Style Reservation System with Weather Information

## Overview
This project is a basic web application that simulates an Airbnb-style reservation system for a single room. It displays current reservations, shows the current weather using a public API, and allows users to make new reservations. The application also handles booking conflicts for dates that are already booked.
